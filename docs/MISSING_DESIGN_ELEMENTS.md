- Consensus and validation patterns from cartesi-stock-exchange
- Scalable microservices architecture from both systems

Success depends on careful prioritization, adequate resource allocation, and maintaining focus on the core value proposition: **Democratic, verifiable, and traceable AI agent decisions based on validated enterprise data**.
